# Project1 - Attempt Google Map API Calls

The longitude and latitude are hard coded in the js code (line 2) for Australia - changed to local log lat.  Add another marker call for another long lat.

Using google Maps for JAvascript in theory we can learn the API query requirements to send the API a list of PIN points to label and display.
